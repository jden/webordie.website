<h1>web or die</h1>
<h2>dot website</h2>
<p>use the Internet. use the World Wide Web. use HTML (hypertext markup language). these are good technologies.
they are pretty easy and widely adopted (your computer probably already runs software that lets you access
these other technologies)</p>
<p>if you choose not to use the World Wide Web, then please don't use any other technologies, like flash,
morse code, iphone operating system, or campfires.</p>
